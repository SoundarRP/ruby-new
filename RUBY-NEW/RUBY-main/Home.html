		Western art had been, from the Renaissance up to the middle of the 19th century, underpinned by the logic of perspective and an attempt to reproduce an illusion of visible reality.
		By the end of the 19th century many artists felt a need to create a new kind of art which would encompass the fundamental changes taking place in technology, science and philosophy.</b>

		The Great Wave off Kanagawa has been described</br> as "possibly the most reproduced image in the history of all art",</br> as well as being a contender for the "most famous artwork in</br> Japanese history".
		Several museums throughout the world hold</br> copies of The Great Wave, many of which came from 19th-century</br> private collections of Japanese prints.</b>

		The agonized face in the painting has become one of the most iconic images of</br> art, seen as symbolizing the anxiety of the human condition. Munch's work, including The Scream, had a</br> formative influence on the Expressionist movement.
		Munch created two versions in paint and two in</br> pastels, as well as a lithograph stone from which several prints survive. Both painted versions have been</br> stolen, but since recovered. In 2012, one of the pastel versions commanded the at-the-time highest</br> nominal price paid for an artwork at a public auction.</b>
